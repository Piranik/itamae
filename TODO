  2) radiotap: ensure data pad is handled for atheros cards (any others?)
  3) mpdu, fully parse
     o control wrapper
     o +htc
     o support a-msdu etc
  6) 802.1X parsing?
  7) other 802.11 standards i.e mesh
  8) do we extend for 802.2 LLC and layer 3 IP parsing?
  9) default MPDU() does not create err field
 10) allow for invalid values in MPDU (could help identify fuzzing attempts)
 11) Allows for the use of a memoryview instead of a raw string:
  raw1 = "\x00...\0xx"
  buffer = memoryview(raw1)
  dR = rtap.parse(buffer)
  dM = mpdu.parse(buffer[dR.sz:],False)
  this works but is actually slower
 12) consider allowing for building of packets
 13) I cannot remember why I use '@' format byte order specifier in radiotap and
  '=' in mpdu
 19) mgmt frame info-elements
   o for supported rates in info-elements, see Table 8-55 regarding BSS
  membership selector
   o test/confirm
    - _eiderp_
    - _eidsched_
    - qosinfoap and qosinfosta
   o TIM needs further parsing
   o TPC Report, link-margin. Is it processed correctly
   o need a frame with Supported Channels element to look at IOT parse it
   o rehit after taking care of 'easier' elements

   o for vendor specific info-elements is there info out there on the most common
    or some other methods for determining how for example wireshark parses these
    looks like there is some further consistency from wireshark reviews
    elementid (221), length, data where data is
     OUI, followed by a 1 byte Vendor OUI type (0x04 = WPS for Microsoft vendors
   o for BSS Average Access delay & BSS AC Average Access dealy (Std 8.4.2.41 pg
    586) write a func to provide ranges i.e. n ==> 2 <= n <= 14
   o For RDE, see 8.4.1.9, code in values of status code
   o for Supported operating classes see 10.10.1 and 10.11.9.1 for info on
    operating classes element

   o twos complement signed integer value for interference level field in
     Collocated Interference Report element & TPC Report element
   o Info element: Country element is currently treated as 3 unsigned octets but
    see Std, the Max Tx Pwr Lvl/Cov class may actually be unsigned in some cases.
    No definition of when this is
