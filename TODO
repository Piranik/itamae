  2) radiotap: ensure data pad is handled for atheros cards (any others?)
  3) mpdu, fully parse
     o control wrapper
     o +htc - can parse this currently but have not seen any frames to test on
     o a-msdu etc
     o mgmt.atim
  6) 802.1X parsing?
  7) other 802.11 standards i.e mesh
  8) do we extend for 802.2 LLC and layer 3 IP parsing?
  9) default MPDU() does not create err field
 10) allow for invalid values in MPDU (could help identify fuzzing attempts)
 11) Allow for the use of a memoryview instead of a raw string:
  raw1 = "\x00...\0xx"
  buffer = memoryview(raw1)
  dR = rtap.parse(buffer)
  dM = mpdu.parse(buffer[dR.sz:],False)
  this works for radiotap parsing and partially for mpdu parsing - it fails
  on decode('utf8')
 12) consider allowing for building of packets
 13) I cannot remember why I use '@' format byte order specifier in radiotap and
  '=' in mpdu
 19) mgmt frame info-elements
   o for supported rates in info-elements, see Table 8-55 regarding BSS
     membership selector
   o TIM needs further parsing
   o TPC Report, link-margin. Is it processed correctly
   o need a frame with Supported Channels element to look at IOT parse it
   o rehit after taking care of 'easier' elements
     - Measurement Request Element: parse measurement request field
     - Measurement Report Element: parse measurement report field
     - Extended Capabilities element: see comments in _mpdu
     - TCLAS element: parse frame classifier params
     - Challange Text: is there more we can do with this?
     - BSS Available Admission Capacity
     - RIC Descripton element: variable parameters need to be parsed as block ack
       8.4.1.14, 8.4.1.15 and 8.3.1.8
     - HT capabilities element: have to parse the mcs set subfield
     - HT Operation element: have to parse the mcs set subfield
     - Time Advertisement: further parse time value, time error & time update counter
     - Event Request: parse variable event request
     - Event Report: parse variable event request, parse TSF, UTC and Time Error
       (see Time Advertisement element for this)
     - FMS Request & Response: have to parse optional TCLAS elements, TCLAS
       Processing element
     - TFS Request: have to parse optional TCLAS elements, TCLAS Processing element
     - DMS Request: parse remaining DMS descriptor subfields
     - DMS Response: parse remaining DMS status subfields
     - Mesh Link metric: have to parse the link metric See 8.4.2.100.3 and Table 13-5
     - Auth. Mesh Peering Exchange: only the cipher suite is parsed
     - QoS Capability element: determine if sent by AP or non-AP
     - supported Operating Classes: further parsing of operating classes element
     - BSSID index element: have to seperate dtim period and dtim count
     - Multiple BSSID: parse optional sublement
   o for vendor specific info-elements is there info out there on the most common
    or some other methods for determining how for example wireshark parses these
    looks like there is some further consistency from wireshark reviews
    elementid (221), length, data where data is
     OUI, followed by a 1 byte Vendor OUI type (0x04 = WPS for Microsoft vendors
   o for BSS Average Access delay & BSS AC Average Access dealy (Std 8.4.2.41 pg
    586) write a func to provide ranges i.e. n ==> 2 <= n <= 14
   o For RDE, see 8.4.1.9, code in values of status code
   o for Supported operating classes see 10.10.1 and 10.11.9.1 for info on
    operating classes element
   o for Nontransmitted BSSID capability set 8.4.2.48, 10.11.14 & 10.1.3.6
   o non-unsigned values:
     - twos complement signed integer value
       * interference level field in Collocated Interference Report element
       * TPC Report element
       * Time Advertisement element
       * DSE - altitude
       * find any we may have missed
       * vertical speed subelement field in location status subelement 8.4.2.73.6
     - neighbor rpt optional sublements, bearing subelement verify distance &
      relative height as float and signed short
   o Info element: Country element is currently treated as 3 unsigned octets but
    see Std, the Max Tx Pwr Lvl/Cov class may actually be unsigned in some cases.
    No definition of when this is
   o Annex E for operating class and channel number
    - AP Channel Report
    - 20/40 Intolerant Channel Report
   o find all info elements that reference subelements Fig 8-40
   o Std Table 8-160
  29) add Tables 8-99, 8-100, 8-101 to ieee80211
  30) change _parseinfosubel_ to accept a function that is applied to each
   subfield. This allows the subelements to be pulled off and parsed w/out
   requiring two iterations
  31) for information elements, should we set as a dict for even those with one field
  such as ssid? i.e. (ssid_id,{'ssid':ssid_name}) or leave as is i.e.
  (ssid_id,ssid_name)
  32) Have to go through and standarize naming conventions of constants & fcts
