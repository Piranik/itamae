  2) radiotap: ensure data pad is handled for atheros cards (any others?)
  3) mpdu, fully parse
     o control wrapper
     o +htc - can parse this currently but have not seen any frames to test on
     o a-msdu etc
     o mgmt.atim
  6) 802.1X parsing?
  7) other 802.11 standards i.e mesh
  8) do we extend for 802.2 LLC and layer 3 IP parsing?
  9) default MPDU() does not create err field
 10) allow for invalid values in MPDU (could help identify fuzzing attempts)
 11) Allow for the use of a memoryview instead of a raw string:
  raw1 = "\x00...\0xx"
  buffer = memoryview(raw1)
  dR = rtap.parse(buffer)
  dM = mpdu.parse(buffer[dR.sz:],False)
  this works for radiotap parsing and partially for mpdu parsing - it fails
  on decode('utf8')
 12) consider allowing for building of packets
 13) I cannot remember why I use '@' format byte order specifier in radiotap and
  '=' in mpdu
 19) mgmt frame info-elements
   o for supported rates in info-elements, see Table 8-55 regarding BSS
     membership selector
   o TIM needs further parsing
   o TPC Report, link-margin. Is it processed correctly
   o need a frame with Supported Channels element to look at IOT parse it
   o rehit after taking care of 'easier' elements
     - Measurement Request Element
     - Measurement Report Element
     - IBSS DFS element
     - RSN element
     - Extended Capabilities element: see comments in _mpdu
     - request element: there is no definition of the size of each request element id
     - TPSEC element
     - TCLAS element
     - BSS Available Admission Capacity
     - FTE
     - RIC Descripton element: variable parameters unparsed
     - DSE Registered location
     - HT capabilities element: have to parse the mcs set subfield
     - HT Operation element: have to parse the mcs set subfield
     - Time Advertisement: further parse time value, time error & time update counter
     - Event Request & Reprt
     - Diagnostic Request & Report
     - Location Parameters
     - FMS Request & Response
     - TFS Request
     - DMS Request & Response
     - Advertisement Protocol
     - Roaming Consortium
     - Mesh Link metric: have to parse the link metric See 8.4.2.100.3 and Table 13-5
     - Auth. Mesh Peering Exchange: only the cipher suite is parsed
     - QoS Capability element: determine if sent by AP or non-AP
     - supported Operating Classes: further parsing of operating classes element
     - BSSID index element: have to seperate dtim period and dtim count
   o for vendor specific info-elements is there info out there on the most common
    or some other methods for determining how for example wireshark parses these
    looks like there is some further consistency from wireshark reviews
    elementid (221), length, data where data is
     OUI, followed by a 1 byte Vendor OUI type (0x04 = WPS for Microsoft vendors
   o for BSS Average Access delay & BSS AC Average Access dealy (Std 8.4.2.41 pg
    586) write a func to provide ranges i.e. n ==> 2 <= n <= 14
   o For RDE, see 8.4.1.9, code in values of status code
   o for Supported operating classes see 10.10.1 and 10.11.9.1 for info on
    operating classes element
   o for Nontransmitted BSSID capability set 8.4.2.48, 10.11.14 & 10.1.3.6
   o twos complement signed integer value
     - interference level field in Collocated Interference Report element
     - TPC Report element
     - Time Advertisement element
     - find any we may have missed
   o optional subelement parsing see Table 8-240 and 8-115, 8-116 and Figures
     8-218 thru 8-221
    - Multiple BSSID
    - Msmt Pilot Transmission
    - Neighbor report element
   o Info element: Country element is currently treated as 3 unsigned octets but
    see Std, the Max Tx Pwr Lvl/Cov class may actually be unsigned in some cases.
    No definition of when this is
   o Annex E for operating class and channel number
    - AP Channel Report
    - 20/40 Intolerant Channel Report
   o find all info elements that reference subelements Fig 8-40
   o Std Table 8-160
  29) add Table 8-99 Cipher suite selectors to ieee80211
