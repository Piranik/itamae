  2) radiotap: ensure data pad is handled for atheros cards (any others?)
  3) mpdu, fully parse
     o control wrapper
     o +htc - can parse this currently but have not seen any frames to test on
     o a-msdu etc
     o mgmt.atim
     o action frames?
  6) 802.1X parsing?
  7) other 802.11 standards i.e mesh
  8) do we extend for 802.2 LLC and layer 3 IP parsing?
  9) default MPDU() does not create err field
 10) allow for invalid values in MPDU (could help identify fuzzing attempts)
 11) Allow for the use of a memoryview instead of a raw string:
  raw1 = "\x00...\0xx"
  buffer = memoryview(raw1)
  dR = rtap.parse(buffer)
  dM = mpdu.parse(buffer[dR.sz:],False)
  this works for radiotap parsing and partially for mpdu parsing - it fails
  on decode('utf8')
 12) consider allowing for building of packets
 13) I cannot remember why I use '@' format byte order specifier in radiotap and
  '=' in mpdu
 19) mgmt frame info-elements
   o for supported rates in info-elements, see Table 8-55 regarding BSS
     membership selector
   o TIM needs further parsing
   o TPC Report, link-margin. Is it processed correctly
   o need a frame with Supported Channels element to look at IOT parse it
   o not fully parsed
     - Event Report: request type rsna parsing (see TODO)
       (see Time Advertisement element for this)
     - DMS Request: parse remaining DMS descriptor subfields
     - DMS Response: parse remaining DMS status subfields
     - Mesh Link metric: have to parse the link metric See 8.4.2.100.3 and Table 13-5
     - Auth. Mesh Peering Exchange: how to determine if key-replay, gtkdata and
       igtkdata is present
     - QoS Capability element: has to be parsed based on if it was sent by sent
       by AP or non-AP Either figure out how to get that info down or expose the
       fct _eidqoscap_(v,ap) at the public level
     - Multiple BSSID: parse non-transmitted bssid profile
   o for vendor specific info-elements is there info out there on the most common
    or some other methods for determining how for example wireshark parses these
    looks like there is some further consistency from wireshark reviews
    elementid (221), length, data where data is
     OUI, followed by a 1 byte Vendor OUI type (0x04 = WPS for Microsoft vendors
   o for BSS Average Access delay & BSS AC Average Access dealy (Std 8.4.2.41 pg
    586) write a func to provide ranges i.e. n ==> 2 <= n <= 14
   o For RDE, see 8.4.1.9, code in values of status code
   o for Supported operating classes see 10.10.1 and 10.11.9.1 for info on
    operating classes element
   o for Nontransmitted BSSID capability see 8.4.2.48, 10.11.14 & 10.1.3.6
   o Info element: Country element is currently treated as 3 unsigned octets but
    see Std, the Max Tx Pwr Lvl/Cov class may actually be unsigned in some cases.
    No definition of when this is
   o Annex E for operating class and channel number
    - AP Channel Report
    - 20/40 Intolerant Channel Report
  29) add Tables 8-99, 8-100, 8-101 to ieee80211
  31) for information elements, should we set as a dict for even those with one field
  such as ssid? i.e. (ssid_id,{'ssid':ssid_name}) or leave as is i.e.
  (ssid_id,ssid_name)
  32) Have to go through and standarize naming conventions of constants & fcts
  33) in the TCLAS information element addresses in IPv4 & IPv6 are not parsed
  34) have to confirm int2s in _mpdu is correct
  35) confirm Location information reports LCI pg 531 and DSE pg 601
  36) neighbor rpt optional sublements, bearing subelement verify distance &
      relative height as float and signed short
  37) Action Fields
